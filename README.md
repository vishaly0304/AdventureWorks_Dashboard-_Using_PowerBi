Use PowerBi Desktop to:
1) connect and transform the raw data
2) Build a relational data model
3) Create calculated columns and measures with DAX

## Recommendations

Based on the insights report, it's clear that the shorts subcategory has the highest return rate, which is negatively impacting revenue and profit. To address this issue, I would recommend conducting a thorough analysis of the returned shorts to identify the root cause of the problem. This could involve reviewing customer feedback, inspecting the products for defects, and analyse the sales data to identify any trends or patterns.
